# Reinforcement-Learning

This repository is dedicated for various reinforcement learning (RL) environments using `gymnasium`. The goal is to get familiar with different RL environments, understand their dynamics, and eventually use them for developing RL algorithms.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/pahuldeep/Reinforcement-Learning.git
    cd Reinforcement-Learning
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install gymnasium
    ```
